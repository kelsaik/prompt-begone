### Usage
The default configuration of this mod prevents the login news portal window from being shown when you log into a character. You can also choose to configure it to only show the window on your first log-in for the session, while blocking all subsequent showings.

> [!NOTE]
> This mod does NOT affect the ability to manually open the news portal from the main menu UI, nor the MTC store from the inventory.

***
### Commands
> [!TIP]
> Ignore the `!` prefix if typing the command into toolbox `/8` chat.

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| !promptbegone | Toggles first-login prompt visibility. Enabling it will show the window for your next first-session login. Disabling it will always block the window from popping up.|
